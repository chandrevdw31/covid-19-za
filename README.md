South Africa Covid-19 Corona Virus Statistics Made With Vue.JS

**Disclaimer:** This is my personal project done for my own educational purposes. 

Data has been provided by https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za

## Purpose

This repo contains files created for both a standalone website on [Github Pages](https://chandrevdw31.github.io/covid-19-za/) including widgets made using Quasar Framework.
I wanted to add Covid-19 statistics to a WordPress website, however was facing issues with existing plugins. 
Using a raw html editor / shortcode editor like Elementor or XYZ HTML Snippets allowed me to copy the single file into a block easily.
